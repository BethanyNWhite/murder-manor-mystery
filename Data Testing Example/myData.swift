let descriptionArray = ["You are the daughter of Camila Weatherbee and the fiance of Benjamin Topaz. You work as a grade school math teacher who loves to dance (you are a flapper after all) and hate it when people chew with their mouths open. ", "You are an orphan adopted by Dan Spellman and the fiance of Ana Weatherbee. You are currently in college working on your Masters and you love to hit the town after a long night.", "You are a flapper who is desperately in love with Benjamin Topaz. However, you must not let this be known because you are also... the murderer. You hate Ana with a passion for taking your lover and will let this be known in the most gruesome ways.", "You are the detective. Eventually there will be a murder and it will be up to you to solve it. You are undercover as a flirtatious superflapper. You are also one of the Weatherbee family friends.", "You are one of the Spellman/Topaz family friends. You are a retired pastor who tends to stare at others because you believe it helps you see into the depths of their soul. Your biggest pet peeve is when people tell each other to stop being immature. That itself is such an immature thing. ", "You are Luke's sister and one of Benjiman's friends. You are pursuing your passion of carpenting and tend to tell people off for their immaturity because you can't stand immature people! You also really don't like it when people are arguing because it makes you feel insecure. ", " You are one of Benjamin's friends and Lili's boyfriend. You're currently a construction worker and, when speaking, you tend to quote songs instead of coming up with something yourself. The thing you hate most in the world is when people make your younger sister, Merida, feel insecure.", "You are one of Ana's friends, the older sister of Penelope, and Luke's girlfriend. You work as a data analyst and always make sure to say what you think - blunt honesty is the best policy. You also tend to speak for your younger sister Penelope who is generally too shy to do so for herself.", "You are one of Ana's friends and the sister of Lili. You're a nanny who is generally rather uncomfortable around other adults since you spend most of your time with children. Due to this, you tend to allow your older sister Lili to speak for you.", "You are Toni's best friend. You are currently going to college to be an orthodontist and your biggest complaint in the word is the pressure to marry. You yourself are planning on living with you five cats for the rest of your life and don't understand why anyone would want to get married.", "You are one of Anna's high school friends. You are an overly serious architect who has come to believe that your ideas are the most important and your opinions are always correct. You've always despised Tori, your twin sister, who is wasting her life being a halfwitted flapper instead of marrying life a good girl.", "You are the father of Lili and Penelope. You work as a bartender and you've realized that the best way to avoid any argument is to just say 'No offense' before you say anything at all. That way nobody gets angry. Your biggest pet peeve is when people don't take you seriously when you're upset.", " You are the friend of both Benjamin and Merida. You currently are working as an optical assistant and you have problems with realizing when it is appropriate to laugh - something you usually do to try to make people calm down when you're stressed. You can't stand it when people hurt others and tend to laugh a lot in these situations.", "You are the fiance of Cole Stevenson. You're a rather loud, nosy flapper who believes that you have a right to know everything that is going on around you. You love trying to solve mysteries but you hate getting scared despite being known for your audacity." , "You are Sabrina Dingwald's fiance and one of Benjamin's best friends. You are currently a patrol officer at the city's police station. You are overly ambitious and rather full of yourself thinking that since you are a police officer you can handle and are entitled to more than others.", "Your name is Gilbert Clayton and you are a Spellman/Topaz family friend. You are a disabled veteran who currently works as a social worker for fellow veterans. You are like a second father to Benjamin, you actually knew his biological father who was your battle buddy in the military. Consequently, you would do anything for Benjamin.","You are the wife of Gilbert Clayton. You are a brain surgeon who continually feels under stress. You dote upon your husband as well as Benjamin who is like a son or nephew to you. You are generally a quiet person although, when emotional, you can become very loud and forceful. You do disapprove of flappers although you attempt to understand their need for 'individualness.'","You are the mother of Ana Weatherbee. You are an English teacher at a highschool. You greatly disapprove of flappers and that sort of nonsense and are very glad your daughter is finally settling down and marrying.", "You are a family friend of the Spellman/Topaz family. You are a football coach who disapproves of smoking and single girls - both things that distract your players.", "You are one of Ana's friends. You're presently working as a waitress by day and a flapper by night. You are vivacious and know how to get what you want. Although you never want to get married, you support Ana in her decision because she is like a younger sister to you.", "You are Natalie's older brother and one of Ana and Benjamin's friends. You are currently going to college to be an accountant so you will be able to support your foolish sister. You sincerely wish that flappers would settle down and leave this recklessness alone.", "You are one of the Weatherbee family friends. Two of your favorite things are cooking, which explains why you're a chef, and rolling your eyes at people to annoy them. You have problems recongnizing other people's personal space barriers and tend to invade them on a regular basis. However, none of that matters to you as long as you're having a good time.", "You are the twin sister of Toni. You are a superflapper whose one goal in life is to enjoy yourself. You're still young and want to live like it. You don't know how your twin Toni can live within the structured walls he has built for himself. You yourself like to go with the flow of things and make no plans.", "You are Molly's cousin and a Weatherbee family friend. You are a stay-at-home mother with four kids ages 1, 3, 5, and 7. You worry about your cousin, wondering when she will finally settle down and leave her flapperhood behind. You used to be a flapper, but gave it up to marry, as all good girls should." , "You are the brother of Helen Borden. You are consitently trying to keep your little sister in check because she never seems to know when to stop. If she does not get what she wants... well, then again, she usually gets what she wants.", "You are the sister of Dan Spellman and the aunt of Benjamin and Edgar. You are currently an overly dramatic lawyer. Your greatest fear is death. "]
